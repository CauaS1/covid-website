# Covid Website
This is a website made just to practice my main skills.

I made this to put in practice HTML/CSS/JS, where I stayed some time without practing Web Developer, I was just studying React Native. <br>
I taked some screenshots from a template that I took in the Colorlib, I even look the source code, so, there some different things that I couldn't recreate.
